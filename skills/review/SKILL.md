## Pass 1: Fast Review (Sonnet)

Use model `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` for quick scan:

Focus on obvious issues only:
- Clear bugs and errors
- Security basics (XSS, injection, auth flaws)
- Missing error handling on critical paths
- Unused imports/dead code
- Style violations

Be quick - only flag issues you're confident about.

Output as:
```
### Pass 1: Fast Review (Sonnet)
- [ERROR] file:line - description
- [WARNING] file:line - description
```

---

## Pass 2: Deep Review (Opus)

Use model `claude-opus-4-20250514` for thorough analysis:

Think like a senior engineer:
- Architecture and design patterns
- Edge cases and error scenarios
- Performance implications
- Over/under-engineering
- API design quality
- Security in depth
- Maintainability long-term

Take your time - be thorough.

Output as:
```
### Pass 2: Deep Review (Opus)
- [ERROR] file:line - description
- [WARNING] file:line - description
```

## Pass 3: Independent Review (Codex)

Use `mcp__codex__codex` MCP tool for fresh perspective:

```
mcp__codex__codex(
  prompt: "You are an independent code reviewer. Others have already reviewed this code - your job is to catch what they missed.

Review this diff:
[paste diff]

Focus on:
- Things other reviewers typically miss
- Subtle bugs or logic errors
- Security edge cases
- Test coverage gaps
- Documentation clarity
- Alternative approaches worth considering
- Technical debt being introduced

For each finding, specify:
- Severity: ERROR / WARNING / SUGGESTION
- Location: file:line
- Issue and recommended fix

Be thorough but don't repeat obvious issues.",
  sandbox: "read-only"
)
```
