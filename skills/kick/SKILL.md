# Kick — Orchestrator

Thin router. Set up context, then sequence the step-skills: **plan → execute → review → verify → finish**. The heavy work lives in those skills and in the subagents `execute` dispatches, so this context stays lean — the whole session runs in standard 200k.

> **Launch tip:** run the PASIV session with `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_1M_CONTEXT=1` (alias or `.claude/settings.local.json`) so the Sonnet implementer subagents stay on your subscription instead of metered 1M. See `docs/reference/model-optimization.md`.

Each step-skill shares this session's context (`IDENTIFIER`, `WORKFLOW_*`, `REVIEW_PROFILE`, `PARENT_IDENTIFIER`, …) — set those here, then invoke the skills in order, waiting for each one's `>>> … COMPLETE <<<` marker before the next.

**Never perform a step's work inline instead of invoking its skill** — even when it looks faster. Hand-rolling a step is how its opt-ins (token report, auto-reflect, parent cascade, project-board moves) silently drop. If a step-skill fails to load, say so — don't improvise it.

---

## Step 0: Detect backend + workflow config + issue

Read `.pasiv.yml` (`[ -f .pasiv.yml ] && cat .pasiv.yml || echo missing`):
- `TASK_BACKEND` = github | beans | local (default local). `IDENTIFIER` is the issue number / bean ID / local ID.
- Workflow flags from `workflow:` (all default **true**): `WORKFLOW_PLAN_APPROVAL`, `WORKFLOW_TDD`, `WORKFLOW_REVIEW`, `WORKFLOW_VERIFICATION`.
- Opt-ins (default **off**): `WORKFLOW_UI_VERIFY` from `workflow.ui_verify`; `VERIFY_COMMAND` from `verify.command`; `COORDINATOR_MODEL` from `models.coordinator` (any frontier model id the host exposes — used for frontier implementer escalations and substituted for `opus` in built-in review profiles); `TOKEN_REPORT` from `metrics.tokens` (per-model token summary + history at finish); `AUTO_REFLECT` from `workflow.auto_reflect` (run `reflect` at finish when a reflection signal fired).

Get the issue. If the argument is `next` → **Skill:** `task-ops` `get-next` → `IDENTIFIER`. Then **Skill:** `task-ops` `get-context $IDENTIFIER` — one fork returns everything: `ISSUE_TITLE`, `ISSUE_BODY`, `ISSUE_LABELS` (github: also `ISSUE_URL`), `PARENT_IDENTIFIER` (or none), sub-issue list, and sibling context if a parent exists. Store it all — Steps 0.5/1.5/1.75 consume it without further task-ops calls.

## Step 0.1: Load handoff

`ls -1t docs/handoffs/handoff-*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1`. If one exists: read it, incorporate decisions/files/open-questions, follow its "Files to Load" manifest, skip its "What NOT to Re-Read", then archive it (`mv … docs/handoffs/archive/`) and state "Loaded handoff from {date}: {summary}". Else: "No active handoff found."

## Step 0.5: Sub-issues?

From the `get-context` result: sub-issues exist → jump to **Parent Issue Flow**. Otherwise continue.

## Step 0.75: Baseline test run (background)

Start the baseline **in the background** — planning is read-only, so don't block on it. Use the Bash tool with `run_in_background: true`:

```bash
{ npm test || pytest || go test ./... || cargo test || bun test; } > /tmp/pasiv-baseline.log 2>&1; echo "exit:$?" >> /tmp/pasiv-baseline.log
```

The **baseline join** happens later (after plan, before execute — marked in both flows): read the log tail. Pass → continue. Fail → AskUserQuestion (Fix tests first [Recommended] / Proceed anyway / Cancel); on fix, use `systematic-debugging`, re-run via `test-runner`, commit `fix: repair baseline test failures`. No tests found → note it, continue (TDD will create them).

## Step 1–1.9: Position the work

- **1** Display "Working on $IDENTIFIER: $ISSUE_TITLE".
- **1.5** github backend: **Skill:** `project-ops` `setup` → `PROJECT_NUM`/`PROJECT_ID`, then `move-to-in-progress …`; if `PARENT_IDENTIFIER` (from get-context), move the parent to In Progress too.
- **1.75** Sibling context came back with `get-context` — use its files/decisions/notes when planning.
- **1.9** If `ISSUE_LABELS` has `area:frontend`/`area:mobile`: resolve the design system — `.pasiv.yml` `design.system` path if set, else the first of `docs/design-system.md`, `design-system.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `.interface-design/system.md` that exists. Found → read it → `DESIGN_SYSTEM`; reference its tokens/patterns during plan + execute. None → note "No design system found — `/pasiv init` can set one up" and continue.

## Single-Task Flow

**First, create the step checklist as native tasks** — one per step: `Step: plan`, `Step: execute`, `Step: review`, `Step: verify`, `Step: finish` (each blocked by the previous). Mark a step `in_progress` when invoking its skill and `completed` only after its `>>> … COMPLETE <<<` marker (or the gate result) returns. **Never mark a step completed without having invoked its skill.** Before declaring the kick done, run `TaskList` — any step task still pending means you skipped it; invoke its skill now. This checklist survives context growth; the prose above may not.

Invoke the step-skills in order. Each reads the session context above.

1. **Skill:** `plan` — produces the plan, sets `REVIEW_PROFILE`, creates native tasks. Wait for `>>> PLAN COMPLETE <<<`.
2. **Baseline join** (Step 0.75): check the background baseline result before touching code.
3. **Skill:** `execute` — you (Opus) write RED; a fresh Sonnet subagent does GREEN per task; format/lint; full suite. Wait for `>>> EXECUTE COMPLETE <<<`.
4. **Skill:** `review` — runs `REVIEW_PROFILE` (skips itself if `WORKFLOW_REVIEW` false or profile `none`). Wait for `>>> REVIEW COMPLETE <<<`.
5. **Verification gate:** if `WORKFLOW_VERIFICATION` true → mark the verification task `in_progress`; if `WORKFLOW_UI_VERIFY` true and `ISSUE_LABELS` has `area:frontend`/`area:mobile`, first drive the affected flow in the running app (launch, exercise the change, screenshot) and fix any regression you observe; then **Skill:** `verification` (Haiku→Opus escalation), mark `completed`. Else skip.
6. **Skill:** `finish` — completion summary, handoff, merge, close, parent cascade, report. Wait for `>>> FINISH COMPLETE <<<`.
7. **Wrap-up audit:** if `TOKEN_REPORT` is true and the final report above does **not** contain a "Token usage" table, run it now and print the table verbatim:

   ```bash
   TR_SCRIPT=$(find ~/.claude -name "token-report.sh" -path "*pasiv*/scripts/*" 2>/dev/null | head -1)
   [ -n "$TR_SCRIPT" ] && bash "$TR_SCRIPT" "$IDENTIFIER"
   ```

Done.

## Parent Issue Flow (Autonomous)

"Approve once, walk away." Reviews happen at the **Task level only** — Epics/Features are containers.

### Flatten to tasks

Recursively collect every leaf Task under this issue (a sub-issue with no sub-issues of its own is a Task; otherwise recurse).

### Recommend a profile per task

Per task: XS/S → `quick` · M → `standard` · L/XL → `deep`. Security signal (`auth|crypto|password|payment|token|secret|credential|session|login|oauth|jwt|apikey|private|key`) bumps one level (`quick`→`standard`, `standard`→`deep`) and tags `[security]`.

### Present + baseline (once) + approve

Display the hierarchy with each Task's profile and the per-Task workflow. The baseline is already running in the background (Step 0.75) — **join it once** for the whole Epic/Feature after approval, before the first task (on failure, ask as in Step 0.75).

- **`WORKFLOW_PLAN_APPROVAL` true** → AskUserQuestion: "Approve with these profiles?" → Yes (autonomous) / Customize profiles / Cancel. Store `REVIEW_PROFILES` map.
- **false** → auto-approve with recommended profiles (all `none` if `WORKFLOW_REVIEW` also false). Store `REVIEW_PROFILES`.

Move the Epic/Feature to In Progress.

### Process each task (priority order)

Order: `area:db` → `area:infra` → `area:backend` → `area:frontend`; within an area `priority:high → medium → low`. Within an Epic, process Features by the area-priority of their first Task, all Tasks in a Feature before the next.

For each Task: set `IDENTIFIER`/`PARENT_IDENTIFIER` and `REVIEW_PROFILE = REVIEW_PROFILES[task]`, create the same five-step checklist as native tasks (see Single-Task Flow), then run the **same step-skills** — but **skip baseline** (already run) and **skip plan's approval gate** (pre-approved):

1. **Skill:** `task-ops` `get $IDENTIFIER`; github: `project-ops` `move-to-in-progress …`; `task-ops` `get-sibling-context $PARENT_IDENTIFIER`; load design system if UI.
2. **Skill:** `plan` — note `PLAN_PREAPPROVED=true` so it uses the given `REVIEW_PROFILE` and does **not** re-ask. Display the plan briefly.
3. **Skill:** `execute`.
4. **Skill:** `review` (uses `REVIEW_PROFILE`; skip if false/`none`).
5. **Verification gate** (as in single-task flow).
6. **Skill:** `finish` — writes the inter-task handoff and cascades parent closure; returns control here (no per-task "next up" report).

**On error in any step:** STOP, ask "Debug together / Skip this Task / Stop".

### After all tasks

Parents auto-close via `finish`'s cascade. Wrap-up opt-ins run **once here**, not per task: if `TOKEN_REPORT`, run the token report (finish Step 4.5's command) with the Epic/Feature identifier and paste its stdout table verbatim into the final report — the CLI display is the deliverable, not the history file; if `AUTO_REFLECT` and any reflection signal fired during any task, **Skill:** `reflect`. Then find the next issue (`gh issue list --label priority:high --state open --limit 1`, fallback any open) and report the Epic/Feature summary with each Task ✓ and its profile, then "Run `/kick next` to continue."
