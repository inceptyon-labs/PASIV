# GitHub Automation Plugin

## Slash Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/issue add dark mode toggle` | Create a sized & labeled issue |
| `/parent user notifications` | Create parent issue + sub-issues |
| `/start 42` | Plan → Implement → Review → Merge |
| `/start next` | Work on highest priority issue |
| `/sonnet-review` | Quick Sonnet-only review |
| `/3pass-review` | Sonnet → Opus → Codex review pipeline |
| `/3pass-review feature-branch` | Review specific branch |
| `/codex-review` | Codex-only deep review |
| `/backlog` | Create issues from spec.md |
| `/backlog design.md` | Create issues from custom spec |

## Examples

**Create an issue:**
```
/issue add CSV export to reports page
```

**Create a parent issue with sub-issues:**
```
/parent user notification system with email and push
```

**Full implementation flow:**
```
/start 42
```
1. Read issue #42
2. Create implementation plan
3. Select review depth (Light/Medium/Full)
4. Implement using TDD (test-first)
5. Run selected review pipeline
6. Verification gate (fresh evidence)
7. Merge to main & close issue

**Parent issue (autonomous):**
```
/start 41  # parent with sub-issues
```
1. Show all sub-issues with recommended review depths
2. Approve once, walk away
3. Autonomous implementation of all sub-issues
4. Stops only on error

## Review Pipeline

Select review depth during `/start` plan approval:

| Depth | Models | When to Use | Cost |
|-------|--------|-------------|------|
| **Light** | Sonnet | Simple bugs, config, `size:S` | $ |
| **Medium** | Codex | Moderate features, `size:M` | $$ |
| **Full** | Sonnet → Opus → Codex | Complex, security-sensitive, `size:L` | $$$ |

**Smart recommendations**: Based on issue size labels and security file detection (auth, crypto, payment, token, etc.)

**Full 3-pass flow**: Sonnet → FIX → Opus → FIX → Codex → FIX → Done

| Pass | Model | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Sonnet | Bugs, security basics, missing tests |
| 2 | Opus | Architecture, edge cases, performance |
| 3 | Codex | Fresh eyes, what others missed |

## Development Methodology

### TDD Cycle (enforced in `/start`)

```
RED → GREEN → REFACTOR → COMMIT → repeat
```

1. **RED**: Write failing test
2. **Verify**: Test fails for the RIGHT reason (missing feature, not syntax error)
3. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass
4. **Verify**: Test passes, no regressions
5. **REFACTOR**: Clean up if needed
6. **COMMIT**: After each cycle

**Iron Law**: No production code without a failing test first.

### Verification Gate (before merge)

Fresh evidence required for all claims:

| Claim | Required |
|-------|----------|
| "Tests pass" | Run `npm test`, see output |
| "Build works" | Run `npm run build`, see exit 0 |
| "Lint clean" | Run `npm run lint`, see output |

No "should work" or "was passing earlier" - run it fresh.

### Systematic Debugging (when tests fail)

1. **Investigate** - Read full error, identify root cause
2. **Hypothesize** - Form specific theory ("X fails because Y")
3. **Test** - Make ONE minimal change
4. **Verify** - Run tests again

**Three Strikes Rule**: After 3 failed fix attempts, stop and reassess architecture.

## Labels

| Category | Labels |
|----------|--------|
| Type | `enhancement`, `bug`, `documentation` |
| Priority | `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low` |
| Size | `size:S` (1-4h), `size:M` (4-8h), `size:L` (8+h) |
| Area | `area:frontend`, `area:backend`, `area:infra`, `area:db` |

## GitHub Projects Integration

Issues are automatically added to a GitHub Project board.

**Auto-created project**: Named after your repository (created on first `/issue`, `/parent`, or `/backlog`)

**Auto-prioritization**: `/backlog` outputs suggested implementation order based on:
1. Layer dependencies: `area:db` → `area:infra` → `area:backend` → `area:frontend`
2. Parent/sub-issue relationships: Parents before children
3. Explicit dependencies: `Depends on #N` in issue body

**Required token scope**:
```bash
gh auth refresh -s project
```

## Model Optimization

Simple operations run on **Haiku** in forked contexts to save tokens:

| Skill | Model | Operations |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `git-ops` | Haiku | branch, commit, push, merge |
| `issue-ops` | Haiku | create, close, check-off |
| `project-ops` | Haiku | setup, add issue, move status |
