# GitHub Automation - Free Version

**Cost**: $0/month (uses your Claude Code subscription)

## How It Works

### 1. Create Issues from Spec (5-10 min)

In Claude Code, say:
```
Read my spec.md and create GitHub issues for epics and tasks
```

I'll read it, break it down, and create all the issues for you automatically!

### 2. Work on Issues

Pick an issue, work with Claude Code normally.

### 3. Review PRs

**One-time**: Install Claude GitHub App at https://github.com/apps/claude-code

**Every PR**: Comment `@claude review this PR`

### 4. Merge

Fix issues found, then merge.
